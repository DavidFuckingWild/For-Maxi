/*
    I advise you to use the so called 'lambda-expressions' instead of the normal function-keyword.
    Why?
    Because functions have (unlike in other programming languages) a this-keyword and a __proto__-property.
    What they are, how and when to use them will I explain later in the last chapter. 
    The important thing is that the this-keyword can be used in diffrent contextes and that can easely lead to 
    unintended bugs or ugly programming patterns. Especially beginners make mistakes because of that.
    The advantage of 'lambda-expressions' is that they are exactly like functions, but they dont have the this-keyword
    and the __proto__-property.

const lambda = (arg) => { console.log(arg) }
// this on the right side of the assigment-operator(=) is an example for a lambda expressions
// It has a parameter at the beginnig with one argument: (arg)
// which is followed by an arrow: =>
// and then comes the function-body: { console.log(arg) }
// lambdas dont have a function-name. So if you want to use them you have to assign them to a variable: const lambda =

lambda('Hej vÃ¤rlden!')
// once assigned, you can use a lambda like every other function

const lambdaClon = lambda
// also you can assign your lambda-function to an other variable
// ATTENTION! if you use brackets you execute the function, 
// you dont want to do that by an assigment.

lambdaClon('Hoila Maxi, wie geahtsn?')

// Some example how you can rewrite a function as lambda expression

function functionName() {
    //do something
}

//equal to 

const funcName = () => {
    //do something
}

//equal to 

const funcName1 = (arg1, arg2) => {

/*---------------------------------------------------------*/

function functionName2(arg) {

//equal to

const funcName2 = (arg) => {
    //do something
    let something = arg
    //return something
    return something
}

//can also be written without brackets because there is only one argument in the parameter

const funcName2 = arg => {
    //do something
    let something = arg
    //return something
    return something
